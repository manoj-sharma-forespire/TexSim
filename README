TexSim

Python implentation that finds the cosine similarity of two documents.
Steps:
	1. Performs Tokenization (at sentence level first and then at word level)
	2. Removes Stop words from the documents (Removes frequently used words of the English language)
	3. Performs Stemming (returns the root stem of each word)
	4. Forms vectors
	5. Computes the cosine similarity
	
	
Note:
	In order to perform the NLP operations I have made use of NLTK (Natural Language ToolKit http://www.nltk.org/)
